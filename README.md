# design-optimizer

This repo will hold some of the preliminary work for my preliminary exam.

Intro:
Based on [1].

Motivation?

Objectives?

Literature review?

Some of the things that this repo will hold are:
* MMR serpent input files
* Python scripts fore training an Articifial Neural Network (ANN)
* ANN optimizer. This is something I should read more on. Some options are listed in these websites[web1][web2]:
  * Perform gradient descent of the loss function on the input values rather than the weights
  * Bayesian Optimization
  * Random Search
  * What am I trying to minimize/maximize?
    * Maximize reactor lifetime
    * Minimize peaking factor
