# design-optimizer

This repo will hold some of the preliminary work for my preliminary exam.

Some of the things that this repo will hold are:
* MMR serpent input files
* Python scripts fore training an Articifial Neural Network (ANN)
* ANN optimizer. This is something I should read more on. Some options are listed in these websites[1](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/397223/neural-network-for-input-values-optimization)[2](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/193306/optimization-when-cost-function-slow-to-evaluate/193310#193310):
  * Perform gradient descent of the loss function on the input values rather than the weights
  * Bayesian Optimization
  * Random Search
  * What am I trying to minimize/maximize?
    * Maximize reactor lifetime
    * Minimize peaking factor
