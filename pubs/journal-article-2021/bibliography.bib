	abstract = {A machine learning based system performance prediction model is currently created to support the development of autonomous control for small reactors, such as the Transportable Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor (TFHR), which is a 20 MWth compact core proposed by MIT for remote site applications. The prediction model consists of a reactor physics model and a thermal-hydraulic model. It is presently constructed using support vector regression (SVR) with training data generated by multiple cases of a one-dimensional reactor system model. A particle ﬁltering framework is utilized to estimate and update model parameters with noisy instrument measurements. Veriﬁcations of the prediction and ﬁltering models have been carried out using the TFHR reactivity insertion events. Satisfactory performance in predicting the core behavior and in recognizing transient parameters such as reactivity insertion timing and rate is concluded.},

	abstract = {Implicit in any engineering design is an underlying optimization problem, although the exact objective function to be optimized is rarely stated explicitly. Nuclear systems optimization is as old as the discipline of nuclear engineering. Advanced manufacturing in the nuclear industry has opened the door for the re-examination of optimization in a way in which it was not possible before, namely, determining the optimal geometry for a given objective function. A trivial example is the sphere as the shape that minimizes the volume (or mass) of bare fissile material in a critical configuration. However, the problem becomes less trivial under even the simplest of multiphysics considerations. In this work, we develop the solution methodology for finding the minimum volume geometric configurations under the multiphysics constraints of 1,500 pcm excess reactivity and maximum fuel temperature of 618°C under forced-flow cooling conditions. Constraining the solution geometry only to right cylinders, surprisingly yields two disjoint solution regions. Flat, wide (disk-like) cylinders and tall, narrow (rod-like) cylinders both satisfy the constraints and yield very similar minimal volumes. However, the ultimate pursuit of this work is truly arbitrary geometry.},
