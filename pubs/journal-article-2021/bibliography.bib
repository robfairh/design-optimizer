	abstract = {Implicit in any engineering design is an underlying optimization problem, although the exact objective function to be optimized is rarely stated explicitly. Nuclear systems optimization is as old as the discipline of nuclear engineering. Advanced manufacturing in the nuclear industry has opened the door for the re-examination of optimization in a way in which it was not possible before, namely, determining the optimal geometry for a given objective function. A trivial example is the sphere as the shape that minimizes the volume (or mass) of bare fissile material in a critical configuration. However, the problem becomes less trivial under even the simplest of multiphysics considerations. In this work, we develop the solution methodology for finding the minimum volume geometric configurations under the multiphysics constraints of 1,500 pcm excess reactivity and maximum fuel temperature of 618°C under forced-flow cooling conditions. Constraining the solution geometry only to right cylinders, surprisingly yields two disjoint solution regions. Flat, wide (disk-like) cylinders and tall, narrow (rod-like) cylinders both satisfy the constraints and yield very similar minimal volumes. However, the ultimate pursuit of this work is truly arbitrary geometry.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method, based on the artiﬁcial neural network technique, to predict accurately and in real time the power peak factor in a form that can be implemented in reactor protection systems. The neural network inputs are the position of control rods and signals of ex-core detectors. The data used to train the networks were obtained in the IPEN/MB-01 zero-power reactor from especially designed experiments. The relative error for the power peak factor estimation ranged from 0.19\% to 0.67\%, an accuracy better than what is obtained performing a power density distribution map with in-core detectors. The networks were able to identify classes and interpolate the power peak factor values. It was observed that the positions of control rods bear the detailed and localised information about the power density distribution, and that the axial and the quadrant power diﬀerences, obtained from signals of ex-core detectors, describe its global variations in the axial and radial directions. In the power reactor environment, the neural networks would require in the input vector the position of control rods, and axial and quadrant power diﬀerences. The results showed that the RBF networks produced slightly better results than the MLP networks, but, for practical purposes, both can be considered of similar accuracy. The results indicate that they may allow decreasing the power peak factor safety margin by as much as 5\%.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the training of an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) to accurately predict, in very short time, a physical parameter used in nuclear fuel reactor optimization: the local power peaking factor (LPPF) in a typical boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel lattice. The ANN training patterns are distribution of ﬁssile and burnable poison materials in the fuel lattice and their associated LPPF. These data were obtained by modeling the fuel lattices with a neutronic simulator: the HELIOS transport code. The combination of the pin U235 enrichment and the Gd2O3 (gadolinia) concentration, inside the 10 Â 10 fuel lattice array, was encoded by three different methods. However, the only encoding method that was able to give a good prediction of the LPPF was the method which added the U235 enrichment and the gadolinia concentration. The results show that the relative error in the estimation of the LPPF, obtained by the trained ANN, ranged from 0.022\% to 0.045\%, with respect to the HELIOS results.},

	abstract = {Advanced manufacturing has gained tremendous interest in both research and industry in the past few years. Over nearly the same period of time, machine learning (ML) has made phenomenal advancements, ﬁnding its way into many aspects of manufacturing. For the nuclear engineering ﬁeld, the adoption of advanced manufacturing is a compelling argument due to the ambitious challenges the ﬁeld faces. The combination of advanced manufacturing with ML holds great potential in the nuclear engineering ﬁeld, and even further development is needed to accelerate their deployment towards real-world applications. This review paper seeks to detail several key aspects of ML enabled advanced manufacturing that are used or could prove useful to nuclear applications ranging from radiation detector materials to reactor parts fabrication. The applications covered here include new material extrapolation, manufacturing defect detection, and additive manufacturing parameters’ optimization.},

	doi = {10.13182/ NT92-A34701},
	abstract = {A hybrid artificial neural network is used to model the thermodynamic behavior of the Tennessee Valley Authority's Sequoyah nuclear power plant using data for heat rate measurements acquired over a 1-yr pe-
riod. The modeling process involves the use of a self-organizing network to rearrange the original data into several classes by clustering. Then, the centroids of these clusters are used as the training patterns for an artificial neural network that utilizes
backpropagation training to adjust the weights on the connections between artificial neurons. This procedure greatly reduces the training time and reduces the system error. Comparison of the calculated heat rates with those predicted by the artificial neural network gives an error of
{\textless}0.1\%. A sensitivity analysis is then performed by taking the partial derivative of the heat rate with respect to each individual input to secure a sensitivity co-
efficient. These coefficients identified the input variables that were most important to improving the heat rate and efficiency. The methodology reported is an alternative to the conventional modeling procedures used in other heat rate monitoring systems. It has the advantage that the artificial neural network model is based on actual plant data that cover the dynamic range normally occurring over an annual cycle of operation, and it is not subject to linearization or empirical approximations. This process could be utilized by existing heat rate monitoring systems.},
