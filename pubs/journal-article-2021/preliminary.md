Title-A: 

# Objective: What?

The main objective of this work is to find an optimal design of a microreactor.
More specifically, this work seeks for the LBP distribution that minimizes the power peaking factor while preserving a reactor lifetime of more than 20 years.

# Methodology: How?

To fulfill our objective we will use machine learning algorithms.
More specifically, we will use ANNs and genetic algorithms.

# Motivation: Why?

* Why is minimizing the power peak factor desired/necessary?

The reduction of the power peaking factor (PPF) represents a factor of extreme importance (??) for the reactor safety \cite{fernandes-faria_nuclear_2003}.
The local power distribution (LPD) at the hottest part needs to be estimated accurately in order to prevent the fuel rod from melting in a nuclear reactor \cite{bae_estimation_2009}.

LPD ssems different from PFF
Articles that talk about these things:
fernandes-faria_nuclear_2003
bae_estimation_2009
souza_neural_2006
montes_local_2009
erdogan_pwr_2003

Not sure about this, but maybe, reducing the power peaking factor increases the fuel utilization??


* Why is a reactor lifetime of more than 20 year desired/necessary?

What is a microreactor?
The DOE defines a microreactor as a small nuclear reactor that generates from 1 to 20 MWth \cite{us-doe_ultimate_2019}.
Microreactors require limited on-site preparation as their components are factory-fabricated and shipped out to the generation site.
This feature reduces up-front capital costs, enables rapid deployment, and expedites start-up times.
Microreactors can operate independently from the electric grid.
Several microreactor designs are capable of operating for several years without refueling.
These features make the technology appealing for the deployment in remote locations and military bases.

In this work, we set a reactor lifetime of at least 20 years as one of the design requirements.


* Why do we want to use machine learning?
Because it is fast.
MonteCarlo methods are very expensive.
The designing of a reactor requires the trial of many different reactor configurations.
Using a ML algorithm reduces the computational expense by producing a model that replaces the MonteCarlo simulations for obtaining similar results.

Machine learning models can be trained to emulate the behavior of the input/output relationship of the numerical model using a relatively small sample of input/output pairs \cite{zeng_machine_2018}.

Should large sets of data be required, ML has the possibility of providing results with less computational overhead \cite{blevins_machine_2020}.

Monte Carlo approaches generally take minutes to hours to run \cite{wilson_machine_2019}.

Theoretical design codes available for calcualtion the power distribution take several minutes to calculate the channel power distribution.
ANNs produce results much faster and with good accuracy \cite{dubey_quick_1997}.


* Why ANNs?

What are ANNs?

A successfully trained neural network works as a mapping function, which maps a set of input vectors X (n-dimensional space) to a set of output vectors Y (in m-dimensional space) \cite{guo_use_1992}.

Neural networks form the base of deep learning, which is a subfield of machine learning, where the structure of the human brain inspires the algorithms. Neural networks take input data, train themselves to recognize patterns found in the data, and then predict the output for a new set of similar data. Therefore, a neural network can be thought of as the functional unit of deep learning, which mimics the behavior of the human brain to solve complex data-driven problems.

They can automatically extract features from unstructured data like texts, images, and sounds, and deep learning has greatly reduced the time spent to manually create features.

Need to dig a bit more into this.
Because they are accurate?
ANNs are good at finding relationships between a set of inputs and a set of output vectors.

# The Microreactor

Where should I include the characteristics of a microreactor?

Is the tool generalizable? Can it be applied to other problems?
This work focuses on a specific microreactor model.
The ANN requires the translation of the pin locations in the assembly into an array.
This translation is specific to the microreactor under study.
Other reactor types require a different mapping.

This work studies a simple version of a USNC-MMR-like microreactor.
This section describes the characterstics of the microreactor.




# Methodology

## Serpent

This work used Serpent 2.1.31 and the cross-section library JEFF3.1.2 for obtaining the training data for the ANN.

The Serpent Monte Carlo code is a three-dimensional continuous-energy neutron transport application
developed by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.
Monte Carlo neutron transport tools have several reactor physics applications related to criticality safety analyses, radiation shielding problems, detector modeling, and validation of deterministic solvers.
The Monte Carlo methodâ€™s main advantage is its capability to model geometry and interaction physics without significant approximations.
The main disadvantage is that simulating complex systems is computing-intensive, restricting applications to some extent.
